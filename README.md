# Student_Performance_and_Risk_Analyzer
The Student Performance Progression &amp; Risk Analyzer tracks student marks across semesters, identifying trends and risks. It analyzes consistency, subject difficulty, and attendance vs. marks to detect early warning signs. Visual reports (line trends, box plots) help educators take timely actions to support students and reduce dropout rates.
